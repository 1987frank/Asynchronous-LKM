To get familiar with the asynchronous and concurrent processing, kernel locking, efficiency, and callbacks. Implemented an LKM for handling time consuming file operations as encryption, decryption, compression and checksum. This allows user processes to submit these file jobs to kernel and to continue with their own work. Kernel will notify the owner process of the status of the task once the job is finished.
